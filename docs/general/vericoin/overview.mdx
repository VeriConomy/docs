## Presentation

**VeriCoin** is purely a digital currency that runs on its own unique protocol known as Proof-of-Stake-Time (PoST).

**VeriCoin** transactions are nearly instant (currently 10 times faster than Bitcoin); however, upon the upcoming launch of the binary chain that pairs **VeriCoin** with **Verium Reserve**, network transaction speeds will increase exponentially.

Proof of Stake Time rewards investors with variable and compounding interest payments on the coins held within their wallets in return for leaving **VeriCoin**'s digital wallet open and running on their computer, a process known as "staking".

As opposed to Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) protocol that requires large amounts of electricity in the mining of new coins, **VeriCoin** payments of staking interest are how new VeriCoin are minted.

Staking, incentivized through interest payments, serves the purpose of validating transactions on the **VeriCoin** network. This allows anyone with an internet connection, including the world's unbanked and underprivileged, access to a decentralized financial network providing for the transfer and receipt of funds in a matter of seconds.

## Benefits

**Fast:** Transactions are extremely fast, currently 10 times faster than Bitcoin and even faster once VeriCoin pairs with Verium.

**Low Fees:** When you send **VeriCoin**, you’ll only pay an incredibly low 0.0001 VRC/kb transaction fee. Other coins say "low fees" and we invite you to compare.

**Secure:** VeriCoin’s unique PoST protocol encourages decentralization and network security.

**Earn interest:** Coin holders can earn interest annually by staking their coins.

**Binary chain:** VeriCoin will be paired with **Verium** to create the world's first binary chain. This will let the network scale automatically and be even more decentralized. Despite the recent popularity of centralized cryptos, **VeriCoin** developers are dedicated to creating the world’s most decentralized cryptocurrency.

**Fair and Transparent:** No ICO, no premine, fair staking protocol (does not favor large wallets), developers are well-known in the academic and crypto communities.

## Supply & Inflation

As of this writing the circulating supply of **VeriCoin** is around 34 millions. **VeriCoin** is disinflationary, which means the inflation rate decreases over time. Specifically, 600,000 new coins are created ("minted") each year. Since the number of minted coins is fixed and does not increase, over time they represent an ever-smaller fraction of the overall supply. Newly-minted coins are distributed as interest payments to **VeriCoin** holders when they stake their coins.

The interest rate for staked coins is variable (**VeriCoin** was originally named "VariCoin" after the variable interest rate). The current interest rate is always displayed in the VeriCoin wallet.

The supply ratio between **VeriCoin** and **Verium** settle into a 10:1 ratio in early 2020. **Verium** had a higher inflation rate to permit it to "catch up" with **VeriCoin**. Once the ratio of **VeriCoin** to **Verium** becames 10:1, the **Verium** inflation rate dropped dramatically and the 10:1 ratio is maintained from that point forward.
