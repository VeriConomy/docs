# Proof-Of-Work-Time

Proof-of-Work-Time (PoWT) is a novel approach to forming a consensus by introducing a variable blocktime that scales with mining power, where the blockchain speeds up with power increases. This better scales the blockchain, increases transaction speed with power and allows for auto-adjusting more profitable mining. Difficulty dependent blocktime (Max ~6.2 minutes, minimum 15 seconds).
