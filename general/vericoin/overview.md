# Overview

## Presentation

**VeriCoin** is purely a digital currency that runs on its own unique protocol known as Proof-of-Stake-Time (PoST).

**VeriCoin** transactions are nearly instant (currently 10 times faster than Bitcoin); however, upon the upcoming launch of the binary chain that pairs **VeriCoin** with **Verium Reserve**, network transaction speeds will increase exponentially.

Proof of Stake Time rewards investors with variable and compounding interest payments on the coins held within their wallets in return for leaving **VeriCoin**'s digital wallet open and running on their computer, a process known as "staking".

As opposed to Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) protocol that requires large amounts of electricity in the mining of new coins, **VeriCoin** payments of staking interest are how new VeriCoin are minted.

Staking, incentivized through interest payments, serves the purpose of validating transactions on the **VeriCoin** network. This allows anyone with an internet connection, including the world's unbanked and underprivileged, access to a decentralized financial network providing for the transfer and receipt of funds in a matter of seconds.

## Benefits

**Fast:** Transactions are extremely fast, currently 10 times faster than Bitcoin and even faster once VeriCoin pairs with Verium.

**Low Fees:** When you send **VeriCoin**, you’ll only pay an incredibly low 0.0001 VRC/kb transaction fee. Other coins say "low fees" and we invite you to compare.

**Secure:** VeriCoin’s unique PoST protocol encourages decentralization and network security.

**Earn interest:** Coin holders can earn interest annually by staking their coins.

**Binary chain:** VeriCoin will be paired with **Verium** to create the world's first binary chain. This will let the network scale automatically and be even more decentralized. Despite the recent popularity of centralized cryptos, **VeriCoin** developers are dedicated to creating the world’s most decentralized cryptocurrency.

**Fair and Transparent:** No ICO, no premine, fair staking protocol (does not favor large wallets), developers are well-known in the academic and crypto communities.
