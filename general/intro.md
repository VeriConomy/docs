## VeriConomy

**VeriConomy** is the first **dual** blockchain protocol pairing a digital currency, [**VeriCoin (VRC)**](#vericoin),  with a digital commodity, [**Verium Reserve (VRM)**](#verium-reserve) that forms a cohesive decentralized financial system using a unique protocol called [binary chain](#binary-chain).

Current [digital currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) *(Bitcoin, Doge, Dash)* face the impossible task of attempting to be both a fast currency and a secure store of value. VeriConomy solve this problem by incorporating complementary protocols known as binary chain.

**Vericoin’s** Proof-of-Stake-Time (PoST) and **Verium’s** Proof-of-Work-Time (PoWT) protocols leverage complementary technologies to form a symbiotic and advanced dual blockchain ecosystem that not only greatly enhances network security, but exponentially accelerates transaction times. The novel pairing of advanced dual blockchain technologies has become known as the VeriConomy.

By building a consensus-paired digital ecosystem, the currency (**VeriCoin**) can scale to mass usage and remain extremely inexpensive, and the reserve commodity (**Verium Reserve**) can scale while stabilizing value via a growing supply cost.

## VeriCoin (VRC) {#vericoin}

**VeriCoin** is purely a digital currency that runs on its own unique protocol known as Proof-of-Stake-Time (PoST).

**VeriCoin** transactions are nearly instant (currently 10 times faster than Bitcoin); however, upon the upcoming launch of the binary chain that pairs **VeriCoin** with **Verium Reserve**, network transaction speeds will increase exponentially.

Proof of Stake Time rewards investors with variable and compounding interest payments on the coins held within their wallets in return for leaving **VeriCoin**'s digital wallet open and running on their computer, a process known as "staking".

As opposed to Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) protocol that requires large amounts of electricity in the mining of new coins, **VeriCoin** payments of staking interest are how new VeriCoin are minted.

Staking, incentivized through interest payments, serves the purpose of validating transactions on the **VeriCoin** network. This allows anyone with an internet connection, including the world's unbanked and underprivileged, access to a decentralized financial network providing for the transfer and receipt of funds in a matter of seconds.

## Verium Reserve (VRM) {#verium-reserve}

**Verium Reserve** was created as an innovative and independent store of value asset in addition to supporting the VeriCoin blockchain. **Verium** own unique protocol PoWT (Proof-of-Work-Time) solves blockchain scaling issues by introducing a new variable block-time paradigm that speeds network transactions with increases to mining power.

Variable block-times allow **Verium** to scale automatically while enhancing transaction speeds and network capacity to ensure high levels of network security at any level of mining throughput.

Through both linking of the binary chain and **Verium’s** auxiliary mining protocol (AuxPOW), **Verium** will also process **VeriCoin** blocks.

This symbiotic protocol will speed **VeriCoin’s** block-time to less than 30 seconds. These technologies enable **VeriCoin’s** network to provide an efficient and scalable system for consumer transactions well beyond current standards.

## Binary Chain

The Dual Blockchain (or Binary-Chain) pairs a digital currency (**VeriCoin**) with a digital reserve (**Verium Reserve**). It secures and accelerates transactions by leveraging complementary protocol technologies (Proof-of-Stake-Time and Proof-of-Work-Time), into a blockchain system. Thus offering a comprehensive solution to ensure low cost, secure, fast and scalable digital transactions This means faster transactions, more security and solves the digital currency scalability puzzle.
