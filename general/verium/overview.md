# Overview

## Presentation

**Verium Reserve** was created as an innovative and independent store of value asset in addition to supporting the VeriCoin blockchain. **Verium** own unique protocol PoWT (Proof-of-Work-Time) solves blockchain scaling issues by introducing a new variable block-time paradigm that speeds network transactions with increases to mining power.

Variable block-times allow **Verium** to scale automatically while enhancing transaction speeds and network capacity to ensure high levels of network security at any level of mining throughput.

Through both linking of the binary chain and **Verium’s** auxiliary mining protocol (AuxPOW), **Verium** will also process **VeriCoin** blocks.

This symbiotic protocol will speed **VeriCoin’s** block-time to less than 30 seconds. These technologies enable **VeriCoin’s** network to provide an efficient and scalable system for consumer transactions well beyond current standards.

## Benefits

**CPU Mining**: Mining Verium can only be done by using CPU. CPU have the great advantage to use way less power than GPU & ASIC and the energy consumption usage between a 0% - 100% cpu usage is low. CPU also have a higher lifetime.

**ASIC & GPU Resistant:** The scrypt² algorithm allows anyone with a Computer to mine **Verium**. Since it is ASIC and GPU resistant, this allows more individuals to participate. This results in a more decentralized network and improved security.

**Variable Block-Time**: Introducing a new variable block-time paradigm that speeds up as mining power increases. This allows **Verium** to automatically scale, enhance transaction speed and capacity, while ensuring security at any level of mining.

**Aux Pow**: Through **Verium’s** auxiliary mining protocol, **Verium** will also process **VeriCoin** blocks. This process will speed up VeriCoin’s block-time to 30 seconds or faster. This enables **VeriCoin’s** network to provide an efficient and scalable ecosystem for consumer transactions well beyond current standards.
