Contributing to Vericonomy Docs
================================

The Vericonomy project operates an open contributor model where anyone is
welcome to contribute towards translation, documentation and review.
This document explains the practical process and guidelines for
contributing.

Firstly in terms of structure, there is no particular concept of "Core
developers" in the sense of privileged people. Open source often naturally
revolves around meritocracy where longer term contributors gain more trust from
the developer community. However, some hierarchy is necessary for practical
purposes. As such there are repository "maintainers" who are responsible for
merging pull requests as well as a "lead maintainer" who is responsible for the
release cycle, overall merging, moderation and appointment of maintainers.

Release Policy
--------------

The project leader is the release manager for each Vericonomy release.
